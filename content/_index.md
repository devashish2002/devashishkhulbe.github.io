title: "About me"
---

I am a researcher and Ph.D. candidate specializing in Deep Learning and its applications. Currently, my research at MUNI Digital City Lab focuses on developing efficient, high-precision graph representations using advanced machine learning models. These are applied in addressing real-world challenges in domains such as transportation and social sciences, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy and operational efficiency.

I have collaborated closely with researchers at New York University, Masaryk University, and Thales Group and have been involved in several interdisciplinary projects that bridge AI and data science with real-world applications. 
My work has been focused on developing novel approaches to graph neural networks, with particular emphasis on interpretability and applications in urban systems.

Some key areas of my research include:

- **Graph Representation Learning**: Developing efficient architectures for large-scale graph data representation and modeling, including knowledge graphs and ontologies.

- **Urban Informatics**: Using AI to understand complex social dynamics and behavioral patterns in Urban Systems.
